                            <p class="style5">The heart is a muscular pump that receives deoxygenated  blood and propels oxygenated blood to different parts of the body. It is  composed of four chambers; the right atrium, right ventricle, left  atrium and left ventricle.</p>
                            <p class="style5"><u>Blood flow through the heart</u><br>
                              On the right side deoxygenated blood from the superior and  inferior vena cava enter the atrium whilst it is relaxed. At the same time,  oxygenated blood from the pulmonary vein empties into the relaxed left atrium.  The two atria then contract forcing the blood into the respective relaxed  ventricles. On the right side deoxygenated blood flows through the right  atrioventricular/tricuspid valve and on the left side oxygenated blood flows  through the left atrioventricular/bicuspid/mitral valve. Next, the ventricles  contract and the valves close. From the right ventricle the deoxygenated blood  is forced through the semilunar/pulmonary valve into the pulmonary trunk and  from the left ventricle oxygenated blood is forced through the semilunar/aortic  valve into the aorta.</p>
                            <p class="style5"><u>Valves</u><br>
                              There are 4 valves of the heart:</p>
                            <p class="style5">1. The  right atrioventricular valve/tricuspid valve separates the right atrium and  right ventricle </p>
                            <p class="style5">2. The  left atrioventricular valve/mitral valve separates the left  atrium and left ventricle </p>
                            <p class="style5">3. The  right semilunar/pulmonary valve lies between the right ventricle and pulmonary  trunk </p>
                            <p class="style5">4. The  left semilunar/aortic valve lies between the left ventricle and the aorta</p>
                            <p class="style5"><u>Structure and function of the valves</u><br>
                              The right atrioventricular valve/tricuspid valve has three  cusps. The left atrioventricular valve/bicuspid valve/mitral valve has two  cusps. These valves open on relaxation of the ventricles and close on  contraction of the ventricles to prevent the flow of blood back up into the  atria. Their cusps point into the ventricles at all times with their free  edges attached to fibrous strands called chordae tendineae. These chordae  tendineae are in turn attached to papillary muscles from the ventricular wall.</p>
                            <p class="style5"> The semilunar valves are composed of three cusps and their  aim is to prevent the flow of blood back into the ventricles after ventricular  contraction. At the centre of each valve is a fibrous nodule and ballooning of  the cusps under back pressure simply presses their opposing surfaces together  shutting off any backflow.</p>
                            <p class="style5"><u>Pericardium</u><br>
                              The pericardium is a double walled sac that contains the  heart and the roots of the great vessels. The pericardium is composed of three  layers:</p>
                            <p class="style5">1. Fibrous  pericardium is the outer layer which attaches to the diaphragm, vena cava,  aorta and sternum</p>
                            <p class="style5">2. Parietal  pericardium is the middle serous layer</p>
                            <p class="style5">3. Visceral  pericardium forms the outer layer of the heart, the epicardium</p>
                            <p class="style5">The pericardial cavity lies between the parietal and  visceral pericardium and contains serous fluid which acts to prevent friction  during movements of the heart.</p>
                            <p class="style5"><u>Layers of the heart</u><br>
                              The heart is composed of three layers: </p>
                            <p class="style5">1. Epicardium  is the outer layer of the heart formed by the visceral pericardium </p>
                            <p class="style5">2. Myocardium  is the middle layer composed of cardiac muscle </p>
                            <p class="style5">3. Endocardium  is the inner layer composed of simple squamous epithelium</p>
                            <p class="style5"><u>Blood supply to the heart</u><br>
                              The coronary arteries supply the myocardium and epicardium  of the heart. The right and left coronary arteries arise from the ascending  aorta.<br>
                              The right coronary artery arises from the right aortic sinus  and gives off two major branches. The marginal branch supplies blood to the  right ventricle and atrium and the posterior interventricular branch supplies  blood to both ventricles.<br>
                              The left coronary artery arises from the left aortic sinus  and also gives off two major branches. The anterior interventricular branch  supplies blood to the walls of the ventricles and the circumflex branch  supplies blood to the left ventricle and atrium.</p>
                            <p class="style5"><u>Venous drainage of the heart</u><br>
                              Deoxygenated blood which has supplied the heart itself is  carried by the cardiac veins which follow a similar pathway to the coronary  arteries. The main four cardiac veins are: the great cardiac vein, anterior  cardiac vein, middle cardiac vein and posterior cardiac vein. These veins drain  into the coronary sinus, the main vein of the heart. The coronary sinus runs in  the posterior atrioventricular groove and then opens into the right atrium.</p>
                            <p class="style5"><u>Innervation of the heart</u><br>
                              The sinoatrial (SA) node generates an electrical impulse  which passes through the atrial musculature on both sides causing them to  contract. Atrial contraction causes the discharge of blood into the relaxed  ventricles. Electrical impulses eventually reach the atrioventricular (AV) node  situated in the interatrial septal region. These impulses from the AV node  travel onward through the atrioventricular bundle (bundle of His) and arrive at  the interventricular septum. In the interventricular septum the bundle divides  into right and left bundle branches which pass to their respective ventricles  and send out many branches called Purkinje fibres. These Purkinje fibres carry  and spread the electrical impulses eventually causing the ventricles to  contract.</p>

                          <div>
                            <p class="style5">The most  common challenge of cardiac MRI image acquisition is overcoming motion artefacts. Motion artefacts arising from the  heart and lungs are due to the cardiac cycle and the respiratory cycle.  Respiratory motion can be eliminated by breath holding or respiratory navigator technique. Artefacts  from cardiac motion however can only be eliminated by ECG gating. ECG gating acquires data during diastole when the heart is at rest. </p>
                            <p class="style5"><strong><span class="style29">R<span class="style30">espiratory artefact reduction</span></span></strong></p>
                            <p class="style31">The most commonly used techniques to  eliminate respiratory artefacts are breath  holding and respiratory navigation.</p>
                            <p class="style31"><strong><span class="style29">Breath holding technique</span></strong></p>
                            <p class="style5">Cardiac scans are normally performed  under expiration. This is because during inspiration there is an increased tendency of the diaphragm to  move and cause changes in anatomical positioning. It is therefore very  important to give proper coaching to the patients before placing them into the scanner.</p>
                            <p class="style5">1. Instruct the patient to breathe in, but&nbsp;not too  deeply<br>
                              2. Instruct the patient to breathe out and then stop  breathing <br>
                              3. Ask the patient to breathe normally after the scan  (usually under 20s)</p>
                            <p class="style5"><em>It is  important that the patient inhale and exhale approximately the same amount of  air during each breath-hold as the position of the diaphragm is an important factor in  ensuring anatomical  positioning reproducibility.</em> </p>
                            <p class="style5"><strong><span class="style29">Navigator  technique</span></strong></p>
                            <p class="style5">Navigator  technique is used for patients who are not able to hold their breath. During  free breathing the motion  of the diaphragm changes the position of the heart, greater vessels and liver causing inconsistent image quality. This is because the same anatomical position  is not found for each sampled  k-space point. A navigator  consists of an intermittent two-dimensional pulse that excites a cylinder of  spins, followed by a readout gradient in the direction of the long axis of the  cylinder to acquire a 1-dimensional profile of the area of interest. The  sequence employs a low flip angle (10) to minimize saturation. The sharp  change in the signal intensity of the lungs and liver along the axis of the box  is used to determine the position of the diaphragm. The navigator pulse is  about 20ms long and is executed every 200ms. A scan acceptance window is calculated  from the preliminary pre-scan data after which the actual scan acquisition  starts. The navigation box detects the position of the diaphragm during each  slice acquisition and imaging only occurs when the diaphragm falls within the  acceptance window.</p>
                            <p><span class="style5"><strong><span class="style29">ECG gating</span></strong></span></p>
                            <p class="style5">Artefacts from cardiac  motion can be suppressed using ECG (electrocardiographic) gating/triggering where image acquisition is synchronised with the cardiac rhythm.  This can be done with either prospective or  retrospective triggering. </p>
                            <p class="style5"><strong>Prospective  Triggering </strong></p>
                            <p class="style5">This technique is most  commonly used for single slice or multi-slice single-phase  cardiac imaging. Prospective triggering avoids  cardiac motion artefact by acquiring images when the  heart is at rest during mid-diastole.  Image acquisition is  triggered after the  R-peak and subsequently at the  same stage in each R-R  interval. Data acquired at phases other than the cardiac rest  period may be degraded by motion artefact.  </p>
                            <p class="style5"><img src="images/POSSITION%20BUTTON/PLANNING/cardiac%20planning%20images/Prospective%20Triggering.jpg" alt="position liver" width="870" height="295" /></p>
                            <p class="style5"><strong>Retrospective  Triggering</strong></p>
                            <p class="style5">This method involves  continuous acquisition of data to produce images  from all phases of the cardiac cycle to construct a  cine movie. Images of myocardial contraction  and relaxation can be used to  detect myocardial dysfunction  and undertake cardiac chamber quantification. </p>
                            <p class="style5">In retrospective  triggering R-tops are automatically detected and data is  acquired over an entire R-R  interval for each specific K-profile. This is repeated  until all K-profiles are acquired.  ECG  data and acquisition timings are then matched during reconstruction to  construct images of all cardiac phases and  construct the cine scan.</p>
                            <p class="style5"><img src="images/POSSITION%20BUTTON/PLANNING/cardiac%20planning%20images/Retrospective%20Triggering.jpg" alt="position liver" width="870" height="266" /></p>
                            <p class="style5"><strong>Triggering  parameters</strong></p>
                            <p><span class="style21">RR  interval</span><br>
                                <span class="style5">This is  interval from one QRS complex peak to the next peak on an ECG scan. The  number of slices that can be acquired in a package  is dependent on the RR interval. If more slices are  required the sequence can be acquired in two packages (ie.  2 RR intervals). </span></p>
                            <p class="style5"><span class="style21">Cardiac  Frequency</span><br>
                              RR  interval is dependent on cardiac frequency  i.e. number of heart beats  per minute. </p>
                            <p class="style5"><span class="style21">Trigger  Delay</span><br>
                              The  delay from detection of the R-peak to start of  acquisition.</p>
                            <p class="style5"><span class="style21">RR Window</span><br>
                              The  RR window sets an acceptable lower and upper limit  for the RR-interval and determines the permitted percentage  variation in the interval length.  The RR-interval lower limit determines the  fastest accepted heart rate and  the upper limit determines the slowest accepted rate. An RR window of 10 and 15  sets an acceptable RR interval of between 90% (110 minus 10%) and  115% (110+15%). </p>
                            <p class="style5"><span class="style21">Arrhythmia  Rejection </span><br>
                              Useful  in cases of patients with marked cardiac arrhythmia.  Data acquired outside  the permitted R-R window is rejected. In prospective  triggering, arrhythmia rejection skips two R-R intervals (i.e.  one R-R interval after the irregular beat). The system  then resumes data acquisition after the next R-peak.</p>

Slices must cover the whole  heart from sternum to thoracic aorta (usually 3-4 slices). Check the position  in the other two planes. All three blocks must be ISO centred to the magnetic  bore to avoid any inhomogeneity artefacts. These localizers are performed with  a combination of ECG gating and a breath-hold. Scans should be performed under  expiration breath-hold with an ECG trigger on every heartbeat (In our department  we instruct the patients to breathe in and out twice before the “breathe out  and hold” instruction).</p>

                            <p class="style5">Dark blood sequences use a double preparation pulse. Signal from blood and  myocardium inside and outside the slice area is inverted using the first pulse.  The second pulse is a reinversion pulse affecting signal within the measurement  slice only. As blood with an inverted signal flows into the measurement slice  during data acquisition it will appear dark. Data acquisition must be carried out  during the diastole to ensure this effect. Reinversion and data acquisition  must take place in the heart in the same position to ensure  that the tissues in the slice are successfully reinverted.</p>

                            <p class="style5">Cine sequences are used for the  assessment of cardiac function. During cine acquisition several individual  images are acquired in different phases of the cardiac cycle. These are then played  as a movie to provide the user with a ‘video’ of the cardiac activity.  TrueFISP sequences are highly recommended for  cine imaging due to high temporal and spatial resolution and improved blood-  tissue contrast. For cardiac cine imaging TrueFISP is used in combination with  i-pat technology to reduce the acquisition time. </p>

                            <p class="style5">Stress perfusion MRI can help detect ischaemic heart disease which is an undersupply  of blood/ oxygen to the heart. Stress perfusion MRI involves injecting contrast medium where areas of good supply will be well enhanced  and areas  of ischaemia are enhanced less well. </p>
                            <p class="style5">The blood flow  (perfusion) to the heart can be assessed at <em>rest</em> and under <em>stress</em>. Adenosine is injected during the <em>stress </em>test to  simulate the effects of physical exertion. Once the contrast is administered,  those areas of heart muscle with insufficient perfusion can be visualised. The <em>rest</em> test is  usually performed afterwards without adenosine and used for comparison with  images  from the the <em>stress</em> test.</p>
                            <p class="style21"><span class="style5"><strong><span class="style35">Adenosine</span></strong></span></p>
                            <p class="style5">Adenosine - the most commonly used vasodilator  in cardiac imaging - promotes  systemic arterial vasodilation during stress imaging of the heart by inducing  myocardial ischaemia. In a healthy patient it will increase the coronary blood  flow by four to five times the baseline value (0.8-1.2 ml min-1 g-1). Infusion of adenosine will result in the vasodilation of non-stenotic coronary arteries resulting in the redistribution of blood towards the non-stenotic region. The areas of restricted blood flow due  to stenosis will then be visible during the first pass of contrast agent. For stress perfusion MRI, the recommended intravenous  dose of Adenosine is 140  mcg/kg/min infused for 3-6 minutes (total maximum dose of 0.84 mg/kg).  Adenosine  has a very short half-life of less than 10 seconds and due to this, any side effects  caused by adenosine will generally be short lived (usually under 2 minutes) and  easily tolerated. </p>

                            <p class="style5">Adenosine can be injected using an MRI safe adenosine injector  pump. In the absence of an MRI safe pump, a normal adenosine injector pump can  be stationed outside the scanner room and a long line run into the room. The  dosage should then be adjusted according to the length and capacity of the tube (a 6m iv  extension line will hold 12mm of fluid). </p>

After 2 ½ minutes give breath hold instructions, begin  scanning and simultaneously inject contrast (0.5-1.0 mmol/kg at 4ml/s). As  adenosine has a short half-life, the patient’s heart rate should begin to drop  after approximately 30s. </p>

Each segment corresponds to a different&nbsp;TI&nbsp;value. The aim is to determine the optimal TI value to null the signal from normal myocardium.&nbsp;Images are usually obtained  with TI values of 185– 515 ms and are assessed visually by Radiographers. In  images with an optimum TI value the signal intensity of normal myocardium will be  near null, and signal intensity of the left ventricular cavity will be lower  than that of the infarcted region. Incorrect selection of the optimum null time  can result in lower contrast, and may reduce the visible hyper enhanced area  leading to underestimation of the extent of infarction.</p>
