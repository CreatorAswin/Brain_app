	                    <p>Contrast is the difference in  brightness between the light and dark areas of a picture. An MRI image  also  has a contrast, the areas with high signal are bright on the image and the  areas with low signal are dark on the image. The areas with intermediate  signal are  usually gray. Tissues with a large transverse component  of magnetisation give a high signal due to the large signal amplitude. Tissues with a  small transverse component of magnetisation give a low signal  due to the small signal amplitude. </p>

</p>

<p>In  MRI, contrast in the image is obtained through three mechanism i.e. T1 recovery, T2  decay and proton density. The image contrast depends on how much  we allow each process to happen.</p>
<p><strong><em>T1 contrast and weighting</em></strong></p>
<p>The  T1 time of a tissue is the time  it takes for the excited spins to 
recover and be available for the next excitation. Let us take an  example of  fat and CSF in the human body. According to the larmor equation, the frequency  of hydrogen atoms in CSF is higher than that of the hydrogen in fat. Therefore, hydrogen atoms in the  fat recover more rapidly along the longitudinal axis than  CSF. As the T1  time of  fat is shorter than CSF, the fat vector realigns with B0 faster  than that of CSF. Therefore, the longitudinal magnetisation of  fat is larger  than CSF. </p>
 <p><CENTER>
<img src="images/T1%20WEIGHT%20GRAPH.png" alt="" width="480" height="277" /></CENTER>
</p>
 <p>After a certain TR, the next RF excitation pulse is applied  and this will flip the longitudinal magnetisation  of fat and CSF  towards the transverse  plane. As there was more longitudinal magnetisation in  fat before the RF pulse, the net magnetization vector of the fat spins can be flipped  into the X-Y plane more easily as compared to CSF. This means  the  contribution from CSF to the overall signal will be too small in comparison to  fat. Therefore, fat  has a high signal and appears bright on a T1 contrast image  and the low signal CSF will be dark. This  is called  T1 weighted imaging. </p>

 <p><em>Repetition Time (TR) and T1 Weighting</em>.</p>
 <p>Repetition time (TR) is the length of the relaxation period between two 
   excitation pulses and therefore, it is crucial for T1 contrast. TR controls how far each  vector can recover before it is excited by the next RF pulse. For T1 weighting,  the TR must be short enough so that neither fat nor CSF has sufficient time to  fully return to B0. If the TR is too long then both fat and CSF will fully recover to the  longitudinal magnetisation. In that case, the difference in T1 contrast can not be demonstrated in the image.  </p>
 <p>Short TR → strong T1 weighting<br>
   Long TR → low T1 weighting</p>
 <p>For T1 weighting we should chose a short TR.  </p>

 <p><em>Tissues with a short T1 appear bright because they regain  most of their</em> <em>longitudinal magnetization during the TR interval  and produce a</em> <em>stronger MR signal.</em><br>
     <em>Tissues with a long T1 appear dark because they do not  regain much longitudinal magnetization during the TR  interval and  produce a weaker MR signal.</em>
 <p>A typical T1-weighted spin echo (SE) sequence is acquired with a TR/TE 
   of 400/15 msec.

 <p><strong><em>T2 contrast and weighting</em></strong>
 <p>The T2 time  determines how quickly an MR signal fades after 
   excitation.
 Let us take an  example of  fat and CSF again. The T2 decay occurs as a result of energy transfer between spins. The energy  exchange in the hydrogen atoms in fat is more efficient than in  water. As a  result, hydrogen in the fat loses transverse magnetization more rapidly than  in  CSF. The T2 time of fat(80ms) is shorter than the CSF(200ms). Therefore, the transverse magnetisation of fat decays faster. The magnitude of  transverse magnetisation in CSF is large. It therefore appears very bright as compare to fat in T2 contrast image.

 	                 <p><em>Echo Time (TE) and T2 Weighting</em>.</p>
 	                 <p><em>Echo time (TE) </em>is the interval  between application of the excitation pulse 
and collection of the MR signal. If a short echo time is used (25ms), the signal differences between  tissues are small because T2 relaxation has only just started and there has  only been little signal decay at the time of echo collection. The resulting  image has low T2 weighting. If a long echo time is used (100ms), the signal  differences between tissues will be large. Tissues with a short T2 have lost  most of their signal and appear dark on the image while tissues with a long T2   produce a stronger signal and thus appear bright. This is the reason why cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF) with its longer T2 (200ms) is brighter on T2-weighted images as compared to fat(80ms).</p>

                       <p><strong><em>Proton density weighting</em>.</strong> </p>
                       <p>The  proton density (PD) is the  number of excitable spins per unit volume.
Proton density determines the  maximum signal that can be obtained from a given 
tissue. The image contrast  in PD images is not dependent on T1 or T2 relaxation. The signal we receive is  completely dependent on the amount of protons in the tissue. Less protons means  low signal and appear as dark areas on the image whereas more protons produce a lot of signal  and will be bright on the image. Proton density can be  enhance by minimizing the effect of T1 and T2 contrast. If you go back to  the example of fat and CSF, a long TR allows both fat and CSF to fully recover  there longitudinal magnetisation and therefore reduces the T1 weighting and a  short TE does not give fat or water time to decay and therefore reduce the T2  weighting.</p>

                       <p>Short TE → diminish T2 weighting.<br>
Long TR → diminish T1 weighting.</p>
                       <p>A typical PD weighted spin echo (SE) sequence is acquired with a TR/TE 
                         of 2500/15 msec.</p>
                       <p>PD sequences are very useful for evaluating  structures with low signal intensities such as the bones or connective tissue structures  (ligaments and tendons). Proton density weighting is often used for  high-resolution imaging. SE sequences are preferred over FSE sequences for PD  imaging as SE images are less prone to distortion. PD sequences are mainly  used for the imaging of  brain, spine, and musculoskeletal system.</p>

                       <p><strong><em>Magnetization Transfer</em> <em>contras</em>t (MTC).</strong></p>
                       <p>Apart from the water protons, biological  tissues also contain a specific pool of protons bound in macromolecules (normally  proteins and membranes). These macromolecular protons cannot be directly visualized because of  their very short T1. Macromolecular protons have a wider range of Larmor frequencies  than the water protons. Therefore, these macromolecular protons can also be excited by  RF pulses with frequencies slightly different from the Larmor frequency of  hydrogen protons. It is possible to selectively excite a tissue with a large  pool of macromolecular protons without directly affecting the protons in free  water. Repeated delivery of the magnetization transfer pulse saturates the  magnetization of the macromolecular protons and it is transferred to free  protons nearby. This process is associated with a drop in signal that depends  on magnitude, concentration of macromolecules and their interaction with  free water, and is known as magnetization transfer contrast. The magnetisation is transferred by cross-relaxation and chemical exchange. Magnetization transfer pulses are used in spin-echo or gradient-echo sequences   to produce additional signal suppression of tissue water.                       </p>
                       <p><strong><em>Aplications</em></strong></p>
                       <p>  This phenomenon can be useful in some imaging techniques  and therefore named as magnetization transfer imaging. MTC imaging is used in cartilage imaging to improve contrast  between synovial fluid and cartilage. As synovial fluid contains only a few bound protons, it shows only a little magnetization transfer while  cartilage contains a large proportion of bound protons and shows large  magnetization transfer. In brain scanning MTC technique improves the detection  of gadolinium-enhancing lesions. Another use of magnetization  transfer is  in 3D time-of-flight MR  angiography. In time-of-flight MR angiography, contrast between normal, stationary tissue and flowing blood is provided through T1 saturation of  stationary-tissue water by repeated excitation pulses. Additional suppression  of the stationary-tissue water with use of magnetization transfer pulses  enables smaller vessels to be visualized. </p>
