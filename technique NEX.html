                        <p class="style5">Number of excitations (NEX) or number of signal  averages/acquisitions (NSA) is a measurement parameter. It is used to represent  the number of times each line of k-space data is  acquired and is primarily used to improve signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio.  Doubling the NEX only improves the SNR by the square root of two (âˆš2) because  random noise is also sampled. The noise in the  MRI image is from electromagnetic noise in the body resulting from molecular  movement and electrical resistance of the receiver coils. Therefore, as the  number of NEX increases, noise begins to be cancelled out. Repeated sampling  and the accumulation of signal results in a high signal image.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p class="style5">&nbsp;</p>
                        <p class="style5"><img src="images/technique/NEX/averages/Number%20of%20signal%20averages%20(NSA)%20or%20number%20of%20excitations%20(NEX)%20in%20MRI.jpg" alt="Number of signal averages (NSA) or number of excitations (NEX) in MRI" width="888" height="722" /></p>
                        <p class="style5">Doubling  the NEX will increase the SNR by 140% and double the scan time. For example, if  you take a sequence with a scan time of 2 minutes, NEX 1 and SNR of 1 (100%)  and increase the NEX from 1 to 2, this will increase the scan time to 4 minutes  and SNR by 140% or 1.4.</p>

                        <span class="style20">Practical applications of Number of excitations (NEX)</span>
                        <p class="style5">NEX can be used to increase SNR  in high resolution imaging with small field of views. Employing multiple signal  excitations is also effective for reducing motion and pulsation artefacts. The  only disadvantage of increasing NEX is the significant increase in acquisition  time. </p>
                        <p class="style5">&nbsp;</p>
                        <span class="style29"><span class="style5">Number of excitations (NEX)</span> and slice thickness                        </span>
                        <p class="style5">Decreasing the slice thickness in high resolution imaging will  reduce the SNR. The most appropriate way of increasing the SNR is to increase  NEX. For example, if a T1 TSE sequence with a slice thickness of 4mm, NEX 1,  SNR 1 and acquisition time of 2 minutes is changed to a slice thickness of 2mm,  the signal will drop to 0.49 or 49%. In order to compensate for the signal  drop, the user needs to increase the NEX from 1 to 3 but will increase the scan  time from 2 to 6 minutes. This is the most appropriate method when reducing the  slice thickness without compromising image quality.</p>
                        <p class="style5"><img src="images/technique/NEX/averages/Relation%20between%20NEX%2c%20SNR%20and%20slice%20thickness%20in%20MRI.jpg" alt="Relation between NEX, SNR and slice thickness in MRI" width="888" height="545" /></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <span class="style29"><span class="style5">Number of excitations (NEX)</span> and field of view (FOV)                        </span>
                        <p class="style5">Decreasing the FOV will reduce the pixel size and produce an image  with low SNR. In order to compensate for signal loss, the user needs to either  increase the NEX or reduce the matrix size. Decreasing the matrix size will  slightly reduce the image quality whereas increasing the NEX will improve the  image quality. Again, the only disadvantage of increasing the NEX is the  significant increase in scan time. If a T1 TSE sequence with 200mm FOV, NEX 1,  SNR 1 and acquisition time of 2 minutes is decreased to 100mm FOV, the signal  will drop to 0.39 or 39%. The user should increase the NEX from 1 to 4,  increasing the scan time from 2 minutes to 8 minutes. This is the most  appropriate method to use when performing high resolution imaging with a very  small FOV e.g. temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and pituitary imaging. </p>
                        <p class="style5"><img src="images/technique/NEX/averages/Relation%20between%20NEX%2c%20SNR%20and%20Field%20of%20view%20(FOV)%20in%20MRI.jpg" alt="Relation between NEX, SNR and Field of view (FOV) in MRI" width="888" height="395" /></p>
                        <p class="style5">The same principle can be used to reduce the scan time when  increasing the FOV as increasing the FOV will increase the SNR. In order to  reduce the excess signal, the user can reduce the NEX. Taking a T1 TSE sequence  with an acquisition time of 6 minutes, 100mm FOV, NEX 2 and SNR 1, an increase  in the FOV from 100mm to 200 mm will increase the signal to 2 or 200%. To  reduce the excess signal, the user can to decrease the NEX from 2 to 1 which  decreases the scan time from 6 minutes to 3 minutes. </p>
                        <span class="style29"><span class="style5">Number of excitations (NEX)</span> and resolution                        </span>
                        <p><span class="style5">Increasing the matrix size will reduce the pixel size and produce  a low SNR image. To compensate for signal loss the user can increase the NEX.  Increasing either matrix size or NEX will increase the scan time. Increasing  both of these parameters will nearly triple the scan time but the result will  be a very sharp and detailed image. As an example, take a T1 TSE sequence with  parameters: 256x256 matrix, NEX 1, SNR 1 and acquisition time of 2 minutes.  Increasing the matrix size from 256x256 to 320x320 causes a reduction in the  SNR to 0.72 or 72%. The scan time will also increase to 2.31 minutes. In order  to compensate for the signal drop, the user needs to increase the NEX from 1 to  2, however this will increase the scan time from 2.31 to 5.02 minutes.  Nonetheless, it is the most appropriate method to use when performing pelvic  high resolution imaging where both sharp detail and high SNR are  necessary.Â Â </span>Â Â  </p>

                        <p class="style5">Increasing the receiver bandwidth will reduce SNR and increasing  NEX is the most appropriate technique to resolve this. If a T1 TSE sequence  with a receiver bandwidth of 100 Hz, NEX 2 and a relative SNR of 1 sees an  increase in bandwidth from 100 to 250 the new SNR will be 0.49. The signal loss  can be compensated by increasing the NEX from 2 to 3 but again, this will  significantly increase the scan time.</p>

                        <span class="style29">Number of excitations (NEX) and artefacts </span>
                        <p class="style5">Motion artefact is a form of noise commonly caused by physical  movement, respiration, peristalsis and vascular pulsation. Static anatomy  produces consistent signal whereas moving components do not. Increasing the  number of acquisitions will improve the chance of acquiring signals from static  objects, reducing motion artefacts in the resultant image. This method itself  however will not remove motion artefacts completely and result in long scan  times. Respiratory gating/triggers, respiratory compensation (phase  re-ordering), radial k-space filling (BLADE or PROPELLER) and  navigator echoes are more practical methods to counteract motion artefact.</p>
