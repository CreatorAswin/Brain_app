                            <p class="style24">What is MRI?</p>
                            <p class="style27"> MRI is a  medical imaging technique that can produce detailed pictures of many parts of  the body.  An MRI scanner contains a  large magnet with a tunnel through the middle where the patient lies on a  movable bed. When the patient enters the magnet the hydrogen atoms in the water  of their body tissues line up along the magnetic field. Radiofrequency pulses  are then sent in, causing the atoms to ‘flip’ into another plane and then ‘relax’  back when the pulses are turned off. The repeated movement of these particles  produces electrical signals which are picked up by a receiver, or coil, and  then converted into an image by a computer. As tissues such as fat, muscles,  and bone have different densities and water content, they produce different  levels of signal. Similarly, diseased tissues will differ from healthy tissues  and show up on the scan as brighter or darker than normal.    Some scans also require use of a contrast  dye which helps highlight certain tissues and body structures.  </p>
                            <p class="style27"><img src="images/mri%20home%20page/Pictures%20of%20different%20MRI%20scanners.png" alt="Pictures of different MRI scanners" width="865" height="281" border="0" /></p>
                            <p class="style29">Uses of MRI</p>
                            <p class="style27">MRI is a widely  used imaging method which is used to examine many parts of the body including  bones, muscles, ligaments and tendons, the brain and nervous system, organs  such as the kidneys and liver, as well as blood vessels, bile ducts and  intestines. MRI can be used to diagnose disease, trauma or abnormality, assess  the progress of a disease or treatment and to plan surgery.<br>
                              Some of the  most common scans and their indications are:</p>
                            <p class="style27">                              Brain: tumour,  stroke, aneurysm, multiple sclerosis, congenital abnormality</p>
                            <p class="style27">                              Knee: damage to  ACL, collateral ligaments, meniscus </p>
                            <p class="style27">                              Lumbar Spine:  disc prolapse/herniation and nerve root impingement, spinal stenosis, cord and  bony lesions</p>
                            <p class="style27">                              Shoulder: tears  and damage to muscles and ligaments especially the rotator cuff, frequent  dislocation and damage to shoulder joint</p>
                            <p class="style27">                              Breast:  cancerous and non-cancerous lesions<br>
                              MRCP:  gallstones, bile duct obstruction, tumour</p>

                            <p class="style27"><span class="style24">How to prepare for an MRI scan</span><br>
                              <br>
                              Most MRI departments will  send information before your scan telling you what to expect and whether  special preparations are necessary. Some patients need to fast for a few hours  before their MRI, or they may need to take a blood test to check kidney  function. Before your scan you will need to fill in a questionnaire to confirm  that it is safe to go ahead. You should alert the department staff if you think  you may be pregnant, have had metal fragments in your body or eyes, or have any  medical implants in the head or heart, including pacemaker, internal  defibrillator, neurostimulator, aneurysm clips or coils or a mechanical shunt.  </p>
                            <p class="style27">                              Before entering the scanner  room, you should remove all mechanical, magnetic or metal objects from your  clothes and body eg. jewellery, phone, watch, hairclips, money, bank cards.  You may be asked to change into a hospital gown. An MRI scan can last from 10  minutes to an hour or more depending on the part of the body being examined.  Some patients who require a contrast injection will have a small intravenous  line known as a cannula inserted into their arm before the scan starts.</p>
                            <p class="style27"><img src="images/mri%20home%20page/Remove%20any%20of%20these%20items%20before%20entering%20the%20mri%20scanner%20room.jpg" alt="Remove any of these items before entering the mri scanner room" width="864" height="380" border="0" /></p>
                            <p class="style24">During the scan</p>
                            <p><span class="style27">Once in the scanner room you  will lie on the scanner bed and equipment may be placed over the part of the  body being scanned.  You will be given an  emergency buzzer in case you need to call the MRI staff during the scan. A set  of earphones will protect your ears from the loud noises of the machine and let  the staff talk to you directly.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="style27">                            If your scan is long, or you  are feeling nervous you may be able to listen to music. Some departments will  provide music, or you can ask if you can bring a CD or an i-pod.<br>
                            During the MRI scan, the bed  moves into the tunnel running through the middle of the machine. The part of  the body being scanned is in the middle of the tunnel which stays open at both  ends.  The MRI machine makes a series of  loud noises as it takes the pictures. Try to relax and lie still to avoid  blurry images.  In some procedures, you  will be asked to hold your breath for a short period. If contrast dye is to be administered,  it will be injected through a cannula or using a small needle. </span></p>
                            <p><span class="style27"><span class="style28">Claustrophobia: </span>Patients who  know or suspect they suffer from claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces)  should talk to the staff before their scan. For some scans the radiographer may  be able to adapt your positioning, and s/he can talk to you through the headphones  during the scan to provide reassurance. Some claustrophobic patients ask their  doctor to prescribe a mild sedative to help them through the scan.</span></p>

                            <p><span class="style24">What are the risks of an MRI scan</span> </p>
                            <p class="style27">MRI is a very safe and  painless scanning method and uses no radiation. However, as a strong magnetic  field is involved so it is very important to follow the safety guidelines  outlined above. Loose metal or mechanical items must be removed before the scan,  as they may fly into the machine and cause injury or equipment damage. Metal implants  or fragments in the body such as bullets or shrapnel can be dislodged or heat  up during the scan causing injury to the patient.   Mechanical implants such as pacemakers,  neurostimulators and insulin pumps may malfunction as a result of the magnetic  field and place the patient at risk. It is therefore, very important to comply  with the screening process undertaken by the MRI staff before entering a  scanner room.<br>
                              Pregnancy: If you are  pregnant many departments will prefer to wait until the baby has been born or  at least until the end of the first trimester before carrying out a scan.  However, if your doctor deems that a scan is urgent, s/he will carefully  discuss with you the risks and benefits involved.  To date there is no record of harmful effects  from MRI on the unborn baby, although there is a theoretical risk from the  slight heating effects of the scan and from the very loud noises produced by  the scanner. </p>
                            <p class="style27"><span class="style28">Contrast reactions: </span> Unlike the contrast used in CT scans the MRI  dye does not contain iodine, and reactions following MRI contrast injection are  rare. When they do occur they tend to be short-lived and mild – itching, pain  or nausea. A rare condition called Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) affecting the skin  and organs has been associated with MRI injection in patients with severe  kidney disease. MRI staff will screen patients to make sure they do not receive  contrast if this is a risk.</p>
                            <p class="style27"><img src="images/mri%20home%20page/Most%20common%20contraindications%20for%20MRI%20scan.jpg" alt="Most common contraindications for MRI scan" width="860" height="587" border="0" /></p>
                            <p class="style24">After the scan</p>
                            <p class="style27">An MRI scan is sent to a  radiologist or physician trained to interpret the images. The result is then  forwarded to the doctor who requested the scan for you.  Some doctors will ask you to provide CD with  pictures of the scan. You can ask the MRI department how to arrange this.</p>
                            <p class="style24">Open MRI </p>
                            <p class="style27">Open MRI works on the same  principles as normal MRI but the machine is designed so that there is more  space around the body of the patient as they lie in the machine. In many cases, the  sides of the tunnel are removed so the patient can turn their head and look out  into the room. Open MRI is particularly suitable for claustrophobic patients,  bariatric patients (high body mass), children, and elderly patients. </p>
                            <p class="style27"><img src="images/mri%20home%20page/open%20mri%20scanner.jpg" alt="open mri scanners" width="864" height="256" border="0" /></p>
                            <p class="style24">MRI of Children</p>
                            <p class="style27">MRI is generally considered  very safe for children because it does not use ionising radiation. A parent or  carer can generally accompany their child into the room during a scan, and young  babies may sleep through the whole process. However, as the patient needs to stay  still during the scan, older infants and children up to the age of 5 or 6 may  require sedation beforehand.  In this  case, the child’s pulse and oxygen levels will normally be monitored by an  accompanying doctor.  Older children may  be able to stay still during an MRI without sedation. Children can be prepared  for the experience by careful reassurance and age-appropriate explanations of  what will happen during an MRI.  </p>
                            <p class="style23">Advantages and disadvantages  of MRI</p>
                            <p class="style22">Advantages of MRI scanning  include:</p>
                            <p class="style27">                              No use of ionising radiation  so safer than CT for use in children, pregnant women, those requiring frequent  scanning/monitoring<br>
                              Excellent for showing soft  tissues e.g. brain, spinal cord, internal organs, ligaments, cartilages and  muscles<br>
                              MRI contrast agent is less  likely to trigger allergic reactions than CT contrast</p>
                            <p class="style22">Disadvantages of MRI scanning  include:</p>
                            <p class="style27">MRI scanning is expensive and  the scans are relatively lengthy, so availability may be limited<br>
                              Unsuitable for patients with  some metallic or mechanical implants e.g. aneurysm clips, internal  defibrillators<br>
                              Unsuitable for claustrophobic  patients and those with a high body mass index or those unable to tolerate  noise<br>
                              Unsuitable for patients  unable to lie still during the procedure<br>
                              Contrast scans cannot be  carried out on patients suffering from severe kidney disease</p>
